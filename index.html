    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Ball Control</h3>
    <p>
      This project is called ball control and this is a game where the user is a big ball and has to avoid contact from the little ball 
      coming towards them, the little ball comes towards them one at a time. The game keeps track of your score and level and as the 
      level increases the speed increases making it harder for you to avoid the small balls. If the user reaches level 5 or above, 
      the program starts to make 2 small balls come towards them making it harder for the user to dodge them and avoid touching them. 
      This project was made using methods, conditions, loops built-in functions (examples includes round and random) and interactivity. 
      
      
      There might be a minor bug on the code where the small circles are not alligned but apart from that the code should be working
      properly.
